						About Evan Connor
					</h2>
					<p>
						The idea of his first book, Schandiah: The hero's journey, began as the daydreams of a teen. Evan love for the magic of stories led him to craft a novel that he would enjoy reading. The project began as a hobby, a personal challenge; he never intended it to be published. Before he began writing his debut novel, he plotted out the entire adventure. He found that doing some of the same things as his characters allowed him to better understand their world, as well as to think of descriptions that otherwise would not have occured to him. To created his own fantasy world, devoted himself to set up the history of that alternative universe, made up myths and legends that would surround his main history, solved multiple misteries. In short, the books embody a great deal of his experience of living his dreamed novel.
					</p>
					<p>
						Christopher was fourteen when he wrote the first draft of Schandiah: The hero's journey. He took a second year to revise the book, and then gave it to his parents to read. The family decided to self-publish the book and spent a third year preparing the manuscript for publication: copyediting, proofreading, designing a cover, typesetting the manuscript, and creating marketing materials. During this time Evan drew the map for his fantasy world, as well as the book cover (which now appears inside the Knopf hardcover edition). The manuscript was sent to press and the first books arrived in November 2001. The Connor family spent the next year promoting the book at libraries, bookstores, and schools in 2002 and early 2003.

					<p class="align-baseline">
						Evan passion is simple: to explore truth through mind-bending stories that invite readers to see the world through a different lens. Story is the shortest distance between the human heart and truth, and to this he has devoted his life.

						His Story
					</h2>
					<p class="align-baseline">
						Evan was homeschooled by his parents. As a child, he often wrote short stories and poems, made frequent trips to the library, and read widely. Some of his favorite books were Bruce Coville’s Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher, Frank Herbert’s Dune, and Raymond E. Feist’s Magician (now available in volumes one and two), as well as books by Anne McCaffrey, Jane Yolen, Brian Jacques, E.R. Eddison, David Eddings, and Ursula K. Le Guin.
					</p>
					<p>
						After leaving Mexico, Dekker graduated from a multi-cultural high school and took up permanent residence in the United States to study Industrial Engineering. Upon earning his Bachelor’s Degree, he entered the corporate world and proceeded to climb the proverbial ladder. But his personal drive left him restless and, after many successful years, he traded corporate life for wide range of entrepreneurial pursuits that included buying and selling businesses, healthcare services, and marketing.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the early 2010's while visiting a friend who had just written a book, Evan decided to reignite a long held desire to be a published novelist. Over the course of two years he wrote two full length novels before starting from scratch and rewriting both. Now fully enamored by the the process and the stories, he realized that storytelling was in his blood and a new obsession to explore truth through story gripped him anew.
